# End to End Tests

These end to end tests use cucumber feature files to create scenerios to test the message broker.

## Running the tests

You will need to have an instance of the cluster running locally on the ports `2221`, `2222` and `2223`.

E2E tests only work locally currently. Once CI/CD cluster is set up this will be incooperated into this process.
